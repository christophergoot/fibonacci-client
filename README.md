# Fibonacci Generator Client

By [Christopher Gutierrez](mainto:christophergoot@gmail.com) ([christophergoot.com](http://christophergoot.com))

## Instructions

1. Navigate to [repo](https://github.com/christophergoot/fibonacci-client)
2. Clone locally using `git clone https://github.com/christophergoot/fibonacci-client.git`
3. Install using `npm test`
3. Run tests using `npm test`
4. Start application using `npm start`
6. Navigate to app in [browser](http://localhost:3000)

## Technology

- This App was built using HTML, CSS, React, Redux, Jest, Enzyme
- React scaffolding generated by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
- In production, the client would utilize an exterior api, however, currently fakes the response at `src/store.js`

## Requirements

### Develop a simple web UI which will call a fibonacci generator API and display the results. Web UI can just be a straight HTML page which makes the AJAX request. Bonus points for building it in React, Angular or Vue

## Discussion
Setup always seems to take the longest in any app, so, as this is something extremely simple, I chose to use Create-React-App to generate the base app. 

I choose to use Jest and Enzyme as they come pre-installed with create-react-app, and were amply sufficient for an app of this complexity
